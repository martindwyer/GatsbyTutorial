# GatsbyTutorial

This repository contains notes and coding from the Gatsby Tutorial class taught by John Smilga on Udemy. The notes and code here may vary somewhat from those presented in the course. This repository uses Gatsby v4.8.0 while the course materials use v3.0.1. There are also some minor variations in npm package versions which can be gleaned from the package.json file in each project.

In addition to an excellent introduction to Gatsby, the course also offers introduction to commonly used plugins such as image, file system, and helmet. The course also offers an excellent chance to use headless CMS providers including Contentful.

Course Description:

Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered static site generator. It combines together the best parts of React, webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and other front end tools to provide excellent developer experience. Gatsby is far more than typical static site generator though. You can think of it more like a modern front-end framework.

It uses powerful pre-configuration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server side rendering, smart image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching.

The course will consist of two parts. In the first part, the tutorial part we will cover Gatsby basics, and in the second part, projects part, we will build interesting projects using Gatsby.

All project intro videos are available for preview.

With the new Gatsby create blazing fast web experiences that integrate your favorite services and content. Build e-commerce sites, landing pages, blogs and more in minutes.

Go from idea to production in literal minutes with a 10x developer experience. Gatsby is built on popular, proven tech like React and GraphQL, has loads of tutorials and starter templates, and over 2500 plugins that can help integrate all of your favorite web services.

Gatsby loads only critical 1 parts of the page, exactly when the visitor needs it, and not a second sooner. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources 2 for other pages so that clicking on the site feels buttery smooth and responsive. Everything is statically generated at runtime - so your site loads as fast as possible.
